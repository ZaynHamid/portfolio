## Projects

### Stripe Payment System  
**Duration:** May 2025 - June 2025  
I developed a full-stack payment platform integrating Stripe for subscriptions, one-time charges, and usage-based billing. I implemented JWT-based authentication and built an admin dashboard for tracking payment history. The backend is built with Flask and MySQL, while the frontend uses Next.js for a seamless user experience.

### E-commerce Backend with DB and Auth  
**Duration:** April 2025 - June 2025  
I designed and implemented a scalable e-commerce backend using Flask and MySQL, following RESTful architecture. I integrated Stripe Checkout for payments, implemented JWT authentication with role-based access control, and ensured secure product and cart management. I also enhanced security with bcrypt password hashing and rigorous token validation.

### Reminder System  
**Duration:** Nov 2024 - Jan 2025  
I built a user reminder service leveraging BullMQ and Redis for reliable job scheduling and queue management. This system supports configurable task frequencies, retry logic, and sends automated email notifications with Nodemailer to ensure timely reminders.
